# LSTMChatBot

Old LSTM-RNN chat bot I made in college in an attempt to replicate some of the results found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.05869v2.pdf). 

It was originally trained on the [Open Subtitles](http://opus.nlpl.eu/OpenSubtitles-v2018.php) dataset, however the weights file has been missing since it was a while back. 

This is all that remains from what I had saved from my old GitHub account. I haven't yet tested it or rebuilt it, I'm not sure if it works with any of the changes to tensorflow or keras.
